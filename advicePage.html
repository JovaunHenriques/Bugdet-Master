            <h1>General Rules</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Emergency Fund:

                    Allocate a portion of your leftover income to build an emergency fund. This fund should ideally
                    cover 3-6
                    months' worth of living expenses. Aim to reach at least $500 in your emergency fund initially.</li>
                <li>Debt Repayment:

                    If you have any high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, consider allocating a portion of your
                    leftover
                    income to pay it off more quickly. Aim to reach a balance of $500 for this purpose.</li>
                <li>Savings Goals:

                    Identify short-term and long-term savings goals, such as saving for a vacation, a down payment on a
                    house,
                    or retirement. Allocate a portion of your leftover income towards these goals. Aim to reach $2000
                    for a
                    mid-term savings goal, such as a vacation or a major purchase.</li>
                <li>Retirement Savings:

                    Contribute to retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or an IRA. Retirement savings should be a
                    priority, so
                    allocate a significant portion of your leftover income towards this goal. Aim to reach $4000 for
                    long-term
                    retirement savings.</li>
                <li>Investing:

                    Consider investing a portion of your leftover income in stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles
                    to help
                    grow your wealth over the long term. If you're new to investing, you may want to start with low-risk
                    options
                    or seek guidance from a financial advisor.</li>
                <li>Review and Adjust:

                    Regularly review your budget and savings plan to ensure you're on track to meet your financial
                    goals. Adjust
                    your allocations as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, or financial priorities.</li>
                <li>Automate Savings:

                    Set up automatic transfers or deposits to your savings and investment accounts to make saving easier
                    and
                    more consistent.</li>
                <li>Monitor Spending:

                    Keep track of your expenses and look for opportunities to reduce unnecessary spending. Cutting back
                    on
                    non-essential purchases can free up more money to put towards savings and investments.</li>
                <li>Seek Professional Advice:

                    If you're unsure about how to best allocate your leftover income or how to achieve your financial
                    goals,
                    consider seeking advice from a financial planner or advisor.</li>

            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Leftover Income $500 or Less:

                    Prioritize essentials: Ensure that your basic needs such as housing, utilities, groceries, and
                    transportation are covered first.
                    Cut discretionary spending: Review your non-essential expenses such as dining out, entertainment,
                    and
                    shopping. Look for areas where you can cut back to free up more money for savings.
                    Look for additional income opportunities: Consider picking up extra work or finding ways to increase
                    your
                    income to improve your financial situation.</li>
                <li>Leftover Income $1000:

                    Build an emergency fund: If you haven't already, focus on building an emergency fund with at least
                    $1000.
                    This fund can provide a financial buffer for unexpected expenses.
                    Pay off high-interest debt: Allocate a portion of your leftover income towards paying off any
                    high-interest
                    debt to reduce interest payments and improve your financial health.
                    Start saving for short-term goals: Begin saving for short-term goals such as a vacation or a major
                    purchase.
                    Set aside a portion of your leftover income specifically for these goals.</li>
                <li>Leftover Income $2000:

                    Increase retirement contributions: If you haven't already maxed out your retirement account
                    contributions,
                    consider allocating more of your leftover income towards retirement savings.
                    Invest for the long term: Consider investing a portion of your leftover income in long-term
                    investment
                    vehicles such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds to build wealth over time.
                    Review insurance coverage: Review your insurance policies (health, life, auto, etc.) to ensure you
                    have
                    adequate coverage. Allocate funds towards increasing coverage if necessary.</li>
